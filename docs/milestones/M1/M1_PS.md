## Mutual Fund FAQs (Facts-Only Q&A)

### Milestone brief
Build a small FAQ assistant that answers facts about mutual fund schemes—e.g., expense ratio, exit load, minimum SIP, lock-in (ELSS), riskometer, benchmark, and how to download statements—using only official public pages. Every answer must include one source link. No advice.

---

## Who this helps
Retail users comparing schemes; support/content teams answering repetitive MF questions.

## What you must build

### Scope your corpus:
Pick one AMC and 3–5 schemes under it (e.g., one large-cap, one flexi-cap, one ELSS).

Collect 5–10 public pages from INDMoney website.

### FAQ assistant (working prototype):

- Answers factual queries only (e.g., “Expense ratio of ?”, “ELSS lock-in?”, “Minimum SIP?”, “Exit load?”, “Riskometer/benchmark?”, “How to download capital-gains statement?”).  
- Shows one clear citation link in every answer.  
- Refuses opinionated/portfolio questions (e.g., “Should I buy/sell?”) with a polite, facts-only message and a relevant educational link.  

---

### Tiny UI:
- welcome line + 3 example questions  
- and a note: “Facts-only. No investment advice.”

## Key constraints
- Public sources only. No screenshots of the app back-end; no third-party blogs as sources.  
- No PII. Do not accept/store PAN, Aadhaar, account numbers, OTPs, emails, or phone numbers.  
- No performance claims. Don’t compute/compare returns; link to the official factsheet if asked.  
- Clarity & transparency. Keep answers ≤3 sentences; add “Last updated from sources: ”.
